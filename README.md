## My process

1) Built a simple mockup with borders
2) Tuned the behavior of mobile and desktop versions of cards with flexbox
3) Tuned the colors and styling, added custom font

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my second take on this challenge, this time using CSS grid instead of flexbox

### Useful resources

- [CSS box-shadow generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me w/ styling the outer shadow of the card
- [Adobe color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) - A great tool I've used to find complementary colors to make hover effect for the button
- [Grid cheatsheet](https://yoksel.github.io/grid-cheatsheet/) - This helped me a lot w/ setting up flexbox
